This software implements a lookup table solution that enables rapid and accurate determination of Raft commit time (or other SGB-based services) quality. Key parameters—including Raft system scale (N,R), delay modeling for routing paths, statistical thresholds, and quantiles for commit time—are fully configurable. This provides a practical approach to guarantee QoS for Raft services. Systems deploying this solution can credibly commit to clients in SLAs that they deliver Raft services with assured QoS (or other SGB-based services).
